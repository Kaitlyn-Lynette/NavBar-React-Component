# NavBar-React-Component 

This is part of a series that I'm building of components. This component is a navigation bar. For styling I used CSS and for the change in color based on scroll, useState was implemented with an eventlistener listening for a scroll and a turnary statement that changes the class of the div based on the scrollY. For smooth scrolling I'm using the react-scroll package. More section headers can be added to the navbar.
